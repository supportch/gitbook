# dscADSampleInt

```c
BYTE dscADSampleInt(DSCB board, DSCAIOINT* dscaioint);
```

Performs A/D conversions using interrupt-based I/O with one A/D conversion per A/D clock tick. Note that calling this function only starts the interrupt operations in a separate system thread. The function call does not result in an atomic transaction with immediate results. Rather, it starts a real-time process that terminates only when the number of conversions reaches the maximum specified \(one-shot mode\) or if a call to dscCancelOp \(\) is made.

A/D samples resulting from the interrupt operation are stored in the buffer whose pointer is passed to the function in the DSCAIOINT structure.
