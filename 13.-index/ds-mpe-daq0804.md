# DS-MPE-DAQ0804

### Overview

DS-MPE-DAQ0804 is a rugged data acquisition PCIe MiniCard module consisting of both analog and configurable digital I/O. The module is ideal for add-on data acquisition I/O expansion in embedded and OEM applications. The PCIe MiniCard offers 8 single ended or four differential 16-bit analog inputs with an aggregate sample rate of 100KHz maximum, 2048 sample A/D FIFO, four 16-bit analog outputs, and 14 digital I/O lines. The buffered digital I/O lines can be optionally configured as either pulse width modulators or counter/timers.

Diamondâ€™s Universal Driver 8.1.0 software provides driver support for all functions. The DS-MPE-DAQ0804 product comes with the PCIe MiniCard data acquisition I/O module, the CK-DAQ0804 cable kit, and a hardware kit with jumpers and screws.

### Board Initialization

To use the DS-MPE-DAQ0804 board in an appllication using the UD, the dscPCIInitBoard function should use the board macro DSC\_MPEDAQ0804. This is shown in the example below.

```c
dscPCIInitBoard(DSC_MPEDAQ0804 , &dsccb, &board );
```
