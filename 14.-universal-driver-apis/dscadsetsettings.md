# dscADSetSettings

```c
BYTE dscADSetSettings(DSCB board, DSCADSETTINGS* adsettings);
```

Sets the A/D configuration for future A/D conversions. A delay of approximately 10 microseconds occurs during this function call in order to allow the analog circuit on the board to settle on the new settings. On -AT \(auto-calibrating\) boards, if adsettings-&gt;load\_cal is TRUE, then load the A/D calibration settings from the EEPROM for the current A/D range. This results in slightly more accurate A/D conversions but causes an additional, longer delay of approximately 10 milliseconds.
