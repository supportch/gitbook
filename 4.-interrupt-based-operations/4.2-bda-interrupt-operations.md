# 4.2 DA Interrupt Operations

D/A interrupt operations are affected by only one parameter: recycle vs. one-shot. No Diamond Systems boards currently contain a FIFO or other hardware buffer for D/A operations. Each interrupt will output a single point to each specified channel. The application program simply builds a buffer containing the output waveform and then passes it to the function. In one-shot mode, the buffer is output a single time and then the function terminates. In recycle mode, the buffer is output repeatedly until the user calls dscCancelOp.
