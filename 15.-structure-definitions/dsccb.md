# DSCCB

Structure containing hardware settings for the current board. Some elements are unique to particular boards.

### Structure Definition

```c
typedef struct { 

    BYTE boardtype; 
    DSCB boardnum; 
    WORD base_address; 
    BYTE int_level;  
    BYTE DAC_Config; // ONLY USED FOR DMM32DX 
    LONG clock_freq
    BYTE int_level1
    BYTE int_level2
    BYTE int_level3
    WORD fpga
    BOOL FPGAIDMajor
    BOOL FPGAIDMinor
    BOOL FPGARev
    BOOL BoardIDMajor
    BOOL BoardIDMinor
    BOOL BoardRev
    
    } DSCCB;
```

### Structure Members

| Name | Description | Applicable Boards |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| boardtype | The board type constant; automatically filled by dscInitBoard; | Diamond-MM-16-AT, Diamond-MM-16RP-AT, Diamond-MM-AT,P104-GPIO96, Helix, DS-MPE-DAQ0804, DS-MPE-GPIO, Ruby-MM-1616 |
| boardnum | The handle to the board; automatically filled in by dscInitBoard | All boards |
| base\_address | Base address of the board; refer to the board's user manual for valid base address settings | All boards |
| int\_level | Interrupt level of the board; used for boards with only one IRQ. | Diamond-MM-16-AT, Diamond-MM-AT, P104-GPIO96, P104-GPIO96, Helix, Aries, Diamond-MM-32DX-AT, Diamond-MM-32X-AT, GPIO-MM-11, GPIO-MM-21, Onyx-MM, Zeta |
| DAC\_Config | Resolution of the DAC to use in the code. If this flag is set to 0, the driver will always use the DAC as a 12 bit DAC - This helps for backward compatibility. When set to 1, 16 bit DAC will be used. This is only used by the DMM32DX board.For all other boards this field is ignored | Diamond-MM-32DX-AT |
| clock\_freq | Counter maximium frequency | Diamond-MM-16-AT, Diamond-MM-16RP-AT, Diamond-MM-AT, Diamond-MM-32DX-AT, Diamond-MM-32X-AT, Onyx-MM |
| int\_level1 | Interrupt level 1 | GPIO-MM-11, GPIO-MM-21, Onyx-MM |
| int\_level2 | Interrupt level 2 | GPIO-MM-11, GPIO-MM-21, Onyx-MM |
| int\_level3 | Interrupt level 3 | Onyx-MM |
| fpga | FPGA ID | Diamond-MM-AT, P104-GPIO96, Helix, DS-MPE-DAQ0804, DS-MPE-GPIO, Ruby-MM-1616, Aries, Diamond-MM-32DX-AT, Diamond-MM-32X-AT, Zeta, Diamond-MM-16-AT, Diamond-MM-16RP-AT |
| FPGAIDMajor | FPGA ID Major | Aries, Zeta |
| FPGAIDMinor | FPGA ID Minor | Aries, Zeta |
| FPGARev | FPGA revision | Aries, Zeta |
| BoardIDMajor | Board ID Major | Aries, Zeta |
| BoardIDMinor | Board ID Minor | Aries, Zeta |
| BoardRev | Board revision | Aries, Zeta |
