# 3.11 AD Calibration Verification

### Description

On supported boards \(-AT boards\), after performing an A/D autocalibration, you can verify the accuracy of the calibration. This function will return the offset and gain error of each range in LSBs.

The default A/D calibration tolerance for all boards is +/-2LSBs. In general autocalibration will result in errors of +/-1LSB or less.

### Step-By-Step Instructions

Create and initialize an A/D auto-calibration settings structure \(DSCADCALPARAMS\) .

Select the A/D range to verify. For an individual range, select the range number 0-15. For all ranges, select 255.

Call dscADCalVerify and pass it a pointer to this structure in order to verify the A/D calibration of the board. The elements ad\_offset and ad\_gain will contain the error in LSB counts for A/D operations. Values of less than 2 are within tolerance.

### Example of Usage

```c
... 

DSCB dscb; 
DSCDACALPARAMS dscdacalparams; 
BYTE result; 

... 

/* Step 1 */ 

dscadcalparams.adrange = 8; // select the range to verify; 255 = all ranges 

/* Step 2 */ 

if ((result = dscADCalVerify(dscb, &dscadcalparams)) != DE_NONE) 
    return result; 

...
```
