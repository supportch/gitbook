# dscADScanInt

```c
BYTE dscADScanInt(DSCB board, DSCAIOINT* dscaioint);
```

Performs A/D scans using interrupt-based I/O with one scan per A/D clock tick. Note that calling this function only starts the interrupt operations in a separate system thread. The function call does not result in an atomic transaction with immediate results. Rather, it starts a real-time process that terminates only when the number of conversions reaches the maximum specified \(one-shot mode\) or if a call to dscCancelOp\(\) is made.
