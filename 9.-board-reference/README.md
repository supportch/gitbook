# 9. Board Reference

This section lists the boards that are currently supported in Universal Driver. The features and appropriate parameters for the various function calls are explained. The information presented here is only an overview of each board, intended to support software development using the Universal Driver. For complete functional and operating details on each board, please refer to that board's user manual. All of Diamond Systems' product user manuals \(including this one\) are available to download for free on our website at [http://www.diamondsystems.com/support/techliterature](http://www.diamondsystems.com/support/techliterature). Note: Serial port operation is not supported in Universal Driver. Only the digital I/O and board configuration functions are supported on the serial port modules \(Emerald-MM series\).
