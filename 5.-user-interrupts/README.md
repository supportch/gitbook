# 5. User Interrupts

The User Interrupt feature of the Universal Driver enables you to run your own code when a hardware interrupt is generated by an I/O board. This is useful for applications that require special operations to be performed in conjunction with the interrupt or applications where you want to run your code at regular fixed intervals. Universal Driver includes example programs for each board with user interrupt capability to illustrate how to use this feature.
