# 4.3 AD Interrupt Mode Reference

The tables on the following pages describe the behavior of the board and the driver during A/D interrupt operations with various combinations of settings. Each board has slightly different options and characteristics that affect which options apply. These differences are described here.

Note that even when FIFO is disabled, all boards with FIFO still use the FIFO to hold A/D conversions during scan operations. In these cases, FIFO disabled means the interrupt will occur after each scan, while FIFO enabled means the interrupt will occur after enough scans occur to reach or exceed the FIFO threshold.

### Prometheus

The FIFO is always enabled. To "disable" the FIFO during interrupt operations, set FIFO depth = scan size \(or 1 for single conversions\). In this case the descriptions for Modes 0-3 apply. Otherwise modes 4-7 apply.

The FIFO depth is 48. The FIFO threshold is programmable. The power-on default FIFO threshold is 16.

### Hercules-EBX

All tables below apply as described.

The FIFO depth is 2048. The FIFO threshold is programmable. The power-on default FIFO threshold is 1024.

### Diamond-MM-48-AT

All tables below apply as described.

The FIFO depth is 2048. The FIFO threshold is programmable to 1024 or 256. The power-on default FIFO threshold is 1024.

### Diamond-MM-32-AT

All tables below apply as described.

The FIFO depth is 512. The FIFO threshold is programmable. The power-on default FIFO threshold is 256.

### Diamond-MM-16-AT, Diamond-MM-AT

All tables below apply as described.

The FIFO depth is 512. The FIFO threshold is fixed at 256.

### Diamond-MM

This board has no FIFO. Modes 4-7 do not apply. For A/D scans, the interrupt occurs after the first A/D conversion is complete, and the interrupt routine completes the scan operation for the rest of the channels in the scan range. The interrupt rate is still equal to the scan rate.

### Zircon-MM-DX

This board has no FIFO. Modes 4-7 do not apply. For A/D scans, the interrupt occurs after the first A/D conversion is complete, and the interrupt routine completes the scan operation for the rest of the channels in the scan range. The interrupt rate is still equal to the scan rate. Note that Zircon-MM-LC has no counter/timer and is therefore unable to generate A/D interrupts.

| :--- | :--- |
| **Sampling Operation** | Each A/D clock generates a single A/D conversion on the current channel. The channel register is then incremented to the next in the range \(or resets to the lowest if already at the end\). All A/D samples are evenly spaced apart in time. |
