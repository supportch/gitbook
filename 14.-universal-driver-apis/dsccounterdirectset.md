# dscCounterDirectSet

```c
BYTE dscCounterDirectSet(DSCB board, BYTE code, WORD data, BYTE ctr_number);
```

Sets the configuration for an individual counter on an 82C54 chip. This chip is used on all boards with counter/timers except Quartz-MM and Prometheus. This function provides direct access to the 82C54 configuration register, enabling functionality other than simple rate generator. For information on the possible configuration data, see the 82C54 datasheet included with each board's user manual.
