### Structure Members

| Name | Description | Applicable Boards |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| OpStatus | Status of A/D operation. 0 = not running and 1 = running | DS-MPE-DAQ0804, Zeta, Helix, Aries |
| NumConversions | Number of convertions since interrupt started | DS-MPE-DAQ0804, Zeta, Helix, Aries, Diamond-MM-16RP-AT |
| Cycle | To determine the mode of A/D interrupt operation. 0 = one-shot operation and 1 = continuous operation | DS-MPE-DAQ0804, Zeta, Helix, Aries, Diamond-MM-16RP-AT |
| FIFODepth | The depth of FIFO which is required to perform A/D interrupt | DS-MPE-DAQ0804, Zeta, Helix, Aries, Diamond-MM-16RP-AT |
| UF | Flag to determine the FIFO underflow. 0 = no underflow and 1 = FIFO underflow. Underflow is attempt to read was made when FIFO is empty | Aries |
| OF | Flag to determine the FIFO overflow. 0 = no overflow and 1 = FIFO overflow. Overflow is attempt to write into FIFO when FIFO was full | DS-MPE-DAQ0804, Zeta, Helix, Aries, Diamond-MM-16RP-AT |
| FF | Flag to determine the status of FIFO. 0 = FIFO not full and 1 = FIFO is full | DS-MPE-DAQ0804, Zeta, Helix, Aries, Diamond-MM-16RP-AT |
| TF | Flag to determine the comparison between A/D samples in FIFO with programmed threshold. 0 = number of A/D samples in FIFO is less than the programmed threshold, 1 = number of A/D samples in FIFO is equal to or greater than the programmed threshold | DS-MPE-DAQ0804, Zeta, Helix, Aries |
| EF | Flag to determine the FIFO status. 0 = FIFO has unread data in it, 1 = FIFO is empty | DS-MPE-DAQ0804, Zeta, Helix, Aries, Diamond-MM-16RP-AT |
| HF | FIFO half full flag; 0 = FIFO is less than half full; 1 = FIFO is at least half full | Diamond-MM-16RP-AT |
