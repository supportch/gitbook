# dscGetEEPROM

```c
BYTE dscGetEEPROM(DSCB board, DWORD address, BYTE* data)
```

Reads 8-bit data from the EEPROM at the specified address. The EEPROM on all AT boards and Emerald-MM-8 contains 256 bytes. On the AT boards, all 256 bytes are addressable. On the Emerald-MM-8, only the lower 128 bytes are addressable. If there is a timeout failure waiting for the EEPROM to respond, the function will return DE\_OPERATION\_TIMED\_OUT.
