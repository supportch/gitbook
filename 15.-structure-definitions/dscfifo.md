### Structure Members

| Name | Description | Applicable Boards |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Depth | Current FIFO depth pointer | Diamond-MM-16RP-AT |
| Enable | 0 = FIFO is not currently enabled, 1 = FIFO is currently enabled | Diamond-MM-16RP-AT |
| OF | 0 = no overflow, 1 = FIFO overflow \(attempt to write into FIFO when FIFO was full\) | Diamond-MM-16RP-AT |
| FF | 0 = FIFO not full, 1 = FIFO is full | Diamond-MM-16RP-AT |
| HF | 0 = number of A/D samples in FIFO is less than the programmed threshold, 1 = number of A/D samples in FIFO is equal to or greater than the programmed threshold | Diamond-MM-16RP-AT |
| EF | 0 = FIFO has unread data in it, 1 = FIFO is empty | Diamond-MM-16RP-AT |
