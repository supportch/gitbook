# dscSetReferenceVoltages

```c
BYTE dscSetReferenceVoltages(DSCB board, DFLOAT* refs);
```

Stores the autocalibration reference voltages in the EEPROM. These voltages are measured on-board and stored in the EEPROM during the factory calibration process. This is a utility function that normally does not need to be called in a user application.

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| DSCB | The handle of the board to operate on |
| refs | Array containing the reference voltages stored in the EEPROM. These are the voltages from the on-board precision voltage divider circuit that are used for autocalibration. During autocalibration, the driver software will measure the actual reference voltages and calibrate the board until the A/D readings match the stored values. The array size is 8 elements. |
