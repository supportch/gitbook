# dscADSample

```c
BYTE dscADSample(DSCB board, DSCSAMPLE* sample);
```

Performs a single A/D conversion on the currently selected channel. The function first waits for the board to be ready for a conversion. It then starts the conversion and waits for it to finish before reading data from the board. A built-in timer is used to check for board failure. If the timer times out before the conversion completes, the board returns the error code.
